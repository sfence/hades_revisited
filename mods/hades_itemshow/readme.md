Hades Itemshow mod

Use the 'place' key to add or remove an item from a item frame, item showcase or pedestal.
Use a screwdriver on a pedestal or an item showcase to reverse the rotation direction.
Punch the block to force update if items do not appear.

This mod differs from the original itemframes mod and the one included in homedecor modpack in that no one person owns the itemframe or pedestals, they are protected with `minetest.is_protected()` so can have multiple owners or none at all ...
