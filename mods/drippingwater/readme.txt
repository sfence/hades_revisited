# Dripping Water Mod

Originally by kddekadenz,
adopted for Hades Revisited by Wuzzy.

## Description

* Droplets appear under porous blocks below water (dirt, dirt with grass, sandstone, etc.)
* They will stay some time at the block and than they fall down
* When they collide with the ground or liquid, a sound is played and they are destroyed
