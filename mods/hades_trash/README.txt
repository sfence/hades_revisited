This mod adds a plastic trash can.  Right click it, put in your trash, and click the empty trash button.   
You can also throw things in the trash can by pressing "q" or throwing them out of your inventory.

Made it so you can throw stuff in the trash can (by pressing "q")

Made the nodeboxes for the dumpster, the textures for the wooden trash can, and the texture for the dumpster node.  
(with some editing by me)
