# Hades Seeds

This mod is only an API mod which allows mods to register seed nodes.
It doesn't do anything on its own.
Seeds can be placed on the ground and that's it. This mod does not
deal with plant growth, this must be added by other mods.
(since different seeds might grow differently).

For programmers, see `API.md` to learn how to add seed nodes.
