Doors for Hades Revisited

(fork of Doors Redux Mod v1.0 by Leslie E. Krause)

Doors for Hades Revisited is the mod that adds doors, trapdoors and fence gates
to Hades Revisited.
It's a fork of the Doors Redux mod with added functionality.

Some of the notable features include:

- Distinctive sound fx when attempting to open a locked or blocked door
- Multiple locking modes for all doors: unlocked, locked, and shared
- Multiple closing modes for all doors: auto-close, hold-open, and manual
- Support for node-center and node-offset door positions
- Wrench tool cycles between door locking and closing modes
- Screwdriver tool alternates door position and direction
- API to add new door (NOT backwards-compatible!)

With the screwdriver tool you
can reposition almost any door depending on the mode of operation. Left-clicking switches
the hand between left vs. right. Whereas right-clicking switches the position between
center vs. offset. It's really that easy!

The wrench is another powerful tool in your arsenal for manipulating doors and trapdoors.
It can be crafted from just one steel ingot and one steel rod. Like the screwdriver from
Minetest Game, the wrench has two modes of operation.

To adjust the closing mode, right-click the door or trapdoor with a wrench. The changes
will be indicated in chat as follows:

 - Normal (door will remain open or closed as per usual operation)
 - Auto-Close (door will close automatically when opened)
 - Hold-Open (door will be non-closable when opened)

Auto-closing doors are ideally suited for high-traffic commercial buildings like shopping
centers, where doors must not be left open unattended. The closing mechanism activates
after a preset time period, defined by an internal variable.

Hold-open doors are ideal for when you want to allow for uninterupted passage through a
doorway, without having to remove the door entirely. Fire doors in schools are a typical
example of doors that are intended to remain open, except during emergencies.

To adjust the locking mode, punch the door or trapdoor with a wrench. The changes
will be indicated in chat as follows:

 - Unlocked (door may be opened and closed by any player)
 - Locked (door may only be opened and closed by the owner)
 - Shared (door may only be opened and closed by members of the protection area)

When placing a door, it will be unlocked.

Below are some helpful notes regarding functionality that may be somewhat unique
in this mod:

 - Players that have the 'protection_bypass' privilege, can open, close, and otherwise
   manipulate any door regardless of ownership or locking-mode.

 - Use of the wrench and screwdriver is restricted to the owner of the door (in the case
   of protected doors) or, otherwise, members of the protected area.

 - The owner of a protected door can always dig the door that they placed, even when it
   is in a protected area that is controlled by another player.

Custom door definitions may be added by using the API in your own mods.
The following function is available for registering new doors:

   doors.register_door( name, def )
   Registers a door withe the given name and definition table.

Several fields of the definition table are required, but most are optional.

 * def.tiles - the list of textures to apply to the model
 * def.description - the description to show in the craft guide and itemstack tooltips
 * def.inventory_image - the texture for the inventory item
 * def.groups - the group levels of the node ('door = 1' will be added automatically)
 * def.is_lockable - whether the locking mode is adjustable (default is true)
 * def.is_closable - whether the closing mode is adjustable (default is true)
 * def.sound_open - sound effect when opening
 * def.sound_close - sound effect when closing
 * def.sound_locked - sound effect when locked
 * def.sound_locking - sound effect when setting lock state to locked
 * def.sound_unlocking - sound effect when setting lock state to unlocked
 * def.sound_shared - sound effect when setting lock state to shared
 * def.sound_held_open - sound effect when trying to open a door in hold-open state
                         or when center door is blocked
 * def.sound_closing_mode - sound effect when changing door closing mode
 * def.can_center - whether center positioning (default is true)

For programmatically examining and manipulating doors, two API functions are provided:

  doors.get_door( pos )
  Returns an object for working with a door at the given position.

The door object, returned by the function above, provides the following methods:

  door_obj.get_properties( )
  Returns a table with four fields describing the various properties of the door:

   * is_open - true for opened or false for closed, as determined by the state
   * type - either "center" or "offset", as determined by the state
   * hand - either "left" or "right", as determined by the state
   * face - ranges from 1 to 4, corresponding with the value of param2

  door_obj.open( )
  Opens the door, unless it is already in an opened state. This will circumvent any
  ownership checks.

  door_obj.close( )
  Closes the door, unless it is already in a closed state. This will circumvent any
  ownership checks.

A similar function, doors.get_trapdoor( ), allows for working with trapdoors. The object
returned provides the same methods as those above.
