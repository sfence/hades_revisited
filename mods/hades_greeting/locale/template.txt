Welcome to planet Hades!=
Creative Mode is active. You have unlimited supplies.=
Create the buildings of your dreams and have fun! <END OF TRANSMISSION>=
You have stranded on planet Hades.=
Search for some water. Lay down fertile sand next to the water and it will soon turn into dirt. Use the crafting guide to see what you can craft.=
Survive and build a nice habitable place!=
Good luck! <END OF TRANSMISSION>=
Hades Revisited is a very incomplete game, so expect bugs, chaos, ugliness, broken gameplay, and worse.=
That having said, have fun playtesting, and please report bugs to Wuzzy.=
