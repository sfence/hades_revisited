## About

This mod is free software, and is distributed freely. If you find it useful then I ask not for your wealth, but simply to spare your time to consider the world we share by watching [Earthlings](http://earthlings.com/), a multi-award winning film available to watch online for free. A must-see for anyone who wishes to make the world a better place.
