# Hades Revisited
Version 0.12.0

A game for Minetest, focused on terraforming and landscaping.
Based on *Minetest Hades* by Gl√ºnngi.

THIS IS A PREVIEW VERSION OF THE GAME. This game is playable,
but incomplete. And future versions might change a lot
and will often be incompatible and break your old worlds.

Requires Minetest 5.4.0.

## Introduction
Due to a gross miscalculation of the gravitational pull of the volcanic
planet Hades, the latest terraforming attempt of your space crew went
horribly wrong! You managed to survive, but it seems you are stranded
on this hellhole of a planet full of lava, stone and ash for good!

You still have a pickaxe and a few apples. Also, water is hidden inside
the tall and chaotic stone spires. So your only chance of survival is to
search for water, use your crafting skills to form some soil and plant
apple trees. More plants might follow. The underground holds great riches,
but also great dangers, lava is death. With your new acquired resources,
maybe, just maybe, you will turn Planet Hades into a nice, habitable place.

But beware: Many were not so lucky: Mutants will haunt on the surface and
who knows what dangers might hide in the deep underground?

## Installation
You need Minetest 5.4.0 to play Hades Revisited. Minetest can be found

## Important notices and short game guide

* Be sure the `minetest.conf` file in the main Minetest directory doesn't have any parameters who are in conflict with the `minetest.conf` file from the `hades_revisited` directory. Especially mapgen parameters or stuff like `give_initial_stuff = false`
* There only 1 biome, with the focus on terraforming and landscaping
* Not everyone will like this game. But maybe there are some freaks out there ;-)

An attempt to colonize planet Hades went horribly wrong: Your exploration ship disintegrated and you survived with very limited supplies.
Hades is a very young planet and characterized by highly volcanic activities and a lot of fertile ash. Asteroids have brought some water on Hades.
So there are the basics for life, you just need to help it to get the nature going, make the planet habitable and survive.
Not every colonist has duly arrived. Most of them have been mutated and strayed around the planet.
There are creatures and most of them live in the underground and darkness.

## How to start:
You start with the following items: 1 steel pickaxe, 12 apples, 1 wall lamp and a stick.
Watch out for flowing lava above you at first!

Next you should dig some stone to craft a stone sword with the stick.
Now explore the area and search for some water.

Dig some stone and ash to craft fertile sand and place it in neighbor to water to become dirt.
Take a dirt and a apple to craft a sapling. Plant the sapling on dirt to become wood and leaves from the tree.
If you ran out of apples or lost your pickaxe, kill some mutants. They sometimes drop apples, pickaxes and other things.
Make more dirt and place it near water.

Take 2 mossy stone (near water) and a dirt to craft grass.

Grass + dirt = tropical grass.

Dig the grass and the tropical grass to get some seeds.

Plant the seeds on the soil that you have placed over the water source.

And now survive with the crafting guide.


## Things you should know

### Block transformations
* Fertile sand (which must be crafted) turns into dirt in the near of 10 nodes to water and direct contact of a dirt.
* Volcanic ash turns into volcanic sand if leaves are nearly.
* Volcanic sand turns into fertile sand if leaves are nearly.
* Volcanic ash slowly turns into clay when next to water.
* Flowing water turns lava source into water source and flowing lava into volcanic gravel.
* Stone, tuff and cobblestone become burned when next to lava.
* Stone, tuff and cobblestone become mossy when next to water.
* Mossy cobblestone turns into gravel when next to flowing water.
* Chondrite turns into marble if it is below -500 and it must be in near 4 nodes to lava and it also must have direct contact to water.
* Volcanic gravel turns into obsidian below Y=-1000. It must have direct contact to lava and water must be nearly.
* Sugarcane appears near of papyrus. It dosnt need water to grow, just dirt

### Other gameplay stuff
* There is no fire
